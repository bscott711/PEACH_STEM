# PEACH PIT - Robotic Cell Dropper

An ESP32-based embedded control system for automated laboratory cell handling with precision motion control.

## Overview

PEACH_PIT is a multi-axis robotic control system designed for pick-and-drop operations in laboratory environments. Built on the ESP32 platform with FreeRTOS, it provides deterministic real-time control of stepper motors, servos, and linear actuators.

**Current Branch Status**: v3.0 - Fully refactored to an Active Object architecture with lock-free queues, dynamic NVS limit mapping for autonomous sequences, and adjustable UI speeds.

## Features

- **Multi-task FreeRTOS Architecture**: Concurrent task management for motor control, encoder reading, LCD display, servo positioning, and actuator control.
- **Dynamic Sequence Engine**: Interruptible step-based autonomous operation with E-STOP support and dynamic NVS limit lookups.
- **Precision Motion Control**:
  - Z-Axis Stepper motor with TMC2209 driver and optional optical endstops.
  - Servo motor (Arm) with NVS-persisted 3-point calibration targets (Clear, Buffer, Tip).
  - Linear actuator with DRV8871 H-Bridge driver, position tracking, and adjustable PWM speeds.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Adafruit Seesaw I2C Quadrature encoder integration for closed-loop position control and UI manipulation.
- **User Interface**: SPI OLED LCD display (U8g2) for status monitoring, limit setting, and speed adjustments.
- **Safety Features**:
  - Emergency stop (E-STOP) with immediate sequence interruption.
  - Interlocks preventing Z-axis collisions while the Arm is swung out.
  - Hardware optical endstop overrides.
- **State Persistence**: Non-volatile storage (NVS) for physical limits (Z, Actuator, and Arm) and custom sequence speeds (Jog/Go for all axes).

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 DevKit
- **Motor Drivers**:
  - TMC2209 stepper motor driver (UART configurable)
  - DRV8871 H-Bridge (Linear Actuator)
- **Display**: SPI OLED LCD
- **Encoder**: Adafruit I2C Quadrature rotary encoder (4 encoders)
- **Sensors**: Optical Endstops for Z-axis

## Usage

### User Interface

The UI is driven by an encoder with short-press, long-press, and double-press actions:

- **Level 0 (Main Menu)**: Select between Shutdown, Arm, Actuator, Z Motor, and Auto.
- **Level 1 (Sub-Menu)**: Set limits (Top/Mid/Bot or Tip/Buf/Clr), adjust Jog/Go speeds, or clear calibration.

### Sequence Engine

The autonomous sequence engine uses a step-based approach defined in `SystemState.h`:

```cpp
enum SequenceAction {
  SEQ_MOVE_Z,        // Move Z-axis to target limit index (0=Bot, 1=Mid, 2=Top)
  SEQ_MOVE_ARM,      // Move Arm target percent
  SEQ_MOVE_ACTUATOR, // Set actuator to target limit index (0,1,2) with custom speed
  SEQ_WAIT_MS,       // Interruptible delay
  SEQ_WAIT_USER,     // Wait for user button press
  SEQ_MOVE_ARM_AND_Z // Move Arm and Z simultaneously
};
```

Each sequence step can be interrupted by E-STOP events, ensuring safe operation.

## Configuration

Hardware pins and global constants are located in `src/HardwareConfig.h`.
Speeds and limits are dynamically configurable at runtime via the UI and persisted to NVS.

## Task Priorities

FreeRTOS task priorities (higher number = higher priority):

- **EncoderTask** (3): Critical for position feedback
- **Controller** (3): Main UI and input control logic
- **MotorNode** (2): Z-Axis stepper control loop
- **ActuatorNode** (2): Linear actuator positioning
- **ArmNode** (2): Servo angle control
- **LCD** (2): Display refresh

## Project Status

**Active Development** - Current focus on refining the autonomous sequence engine and UI reliability.

### Recent Changes (v3.0)

- **Architecture Refactor**: Replaced shared-memory `controller` blob with `ActiveMotionNode` architecture. Tasks communicate exclusively via lock-free FreeRTOS queues (`messaging.h`).
- **Data-Driven Subsystems**: Extracted `StorageManager`, `InputManager`, and `SequenceEngine`.
- **Dynamic UI Speeds**: Jog and GOTO speeds for all axes are now configurable via the physical Encoder UI and saved to NVS.
- **Dynamic Limits**: `SequenceEngine` now dynamically looks up calibrated physical positions for the Z-Axis and Actuator at runtime, eliminating hardcoded depths.
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Centralized pin definitions to `HardwareConfig.h`.
